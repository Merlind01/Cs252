// Direct Memory Operands 
    // A direct memory operand is a named refrence to storage in memory
    // The named refrencec (label) is automatically dereferenced by the assembler

// Zero Extension
    // When you copy a smaller value into a larger destination, the MOVZX instruction file (Extends)
    //       the uffer half of the destination with 00s

// XCHG 
    // Exchanges the values of two operands 

// Direct-Offset Operands
    // A constant offset is added to a data label to produce an effective address (EA)

// INC AND DEC
    // INC - Incrementing by 1 Up
    // DEC - Deceramenting by 1 Down

// Flags
    // Zero flag - set when destination is 0
    // Sign flag - set when destination is negative 
    // Carry flag - set when unsigned value
